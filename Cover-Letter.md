### Dear Sam Oshin and other Hubbers —

### I’d love to be your new [Staff Design Manager of Brand and Marketing Design](https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/5107333)—and here’s why I think you’ll love to have me:

### First: I’m a strong, creative leader comfortable being a voice for design while advocating for the interests of other teams, too—someone you can trust with taste, execution, and mentorship while you’re strategizing the next big move.

### I empower and protect my team 💂🏻‍♂️. At Twilio I’ve turned the Creative team from a neglected service org.—one that made logos bigger and reacted to last-minute requests for image assets—into a valued partner built on Trust, Service, and Integrity. I’ve improved cross-functional effectiveness with tiered SLAs, streamlined brief templates, and launched self-serve solutions; all of it increasing the number of projects we support by 466% with no increase to fixed costs. Smarter, not harder.

### Second: I’m a clear communicator and one who can 🏃‍♂️ quickly identify the right blend of speed to execution, keeping costs down, and maximizing quality no matter the brief or audience. 
### I’ve made it all: presentations for (and to) C-levels, web design systems  that increased page performance by 80%, multi-channel global campaigns delivering $2.3M in attributed revenue, visual identity governance for teams of 70+ designers, event designs for 10,000 attendees, print production that automated 3,000 sticker sheets with variable data, and stadium animations for 20,881 Chicago Bulls fans. Currently, I lead 8 designers across 15 campaigns per month and 3 web pages per week, collaborating with developers every day on our web experience directed at developer audiences.

### What’s more, I help everyone breathe the brand. 🫶🏼 I care about integrity and how it anchors successful teams. To me, unsung work is the strongest proof of integrity; by distilling company values into actionable design-specific quality standards, to asking the right questions along the way, to robust internal documentation. Even when these might never go to market, I’m rigorous in my principles and I help get everyone on the same page about where the bar is so that we can celebrate when we cross it and make changes when we don’t.

### Thanks for reading. Hopefully this gives you a sense of who I am, what’s important to me, and how (together) we could help anyone write faster, better code.

### Sincerely,       
### — Sky MacFadyen
