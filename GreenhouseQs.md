Why do you want to work at GitHub?

> While I live in Figma and Adobe tools, I am on a journey; learning TypeScript to build designer tooling in Figma, D3.js to play in the world of data journalism, and p5.js to give life to art. I’ll admit…it’s hard—but, I love it. As an insatiable and self-led learner my aim is to use my 10+ years of Creative experience in B2B/B2C/Tech to tell stories where design meets code. Preferably alongside the Hubbers at Github.

Please explain why you would be a good fit for this role?

Have you ever worked remotely before?

>Since before it was cool. Seriously, since 2019.

What do you think are some of the challenges of working remotely, and how would you address them?

>1. Establishing trust — There is no replacement for meeting eachother in person. So, I would focus on finding the right time team on-/off-site while also cultivate a culture of authenticity and humility. Trust is given, not earned. By making empathy a cultural topic to discuss as a team, 
>2. creative collaboration,
>3. "I home from work" vibes — My trick here is acting like we are in an office. In a chat channel for example, my team has built a habit of "entering the room."

How did you hear about this job?

> It came to me via LinkedIn. But, I also know a former employee, so the company has been on my radar for a while.
