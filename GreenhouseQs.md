Why do you want to work at GitHub?

> GitHub has a great employeer brand and I would learn a ton. Furthermore, it aligns with the journey I am on; learning TypeScript to build designer tooling in Figma, D3.js to play in the world of data journalism, and p5.js to give life to art. I’ll admit…it’s hard—but, I love it. As an insatiable and self-led learner my aim is to use my 10+ years of Creative experience in B2B/B2C/Tech to help tell stories that designers + developers are uniquely positoned to tell. Preferably, alongside the Hubbers at Github.

Please explain why you would be a good fit for this role?

> **It's We, ~~not me~~**—I believe that each team member's actions can be a positive reflection of the collective. And when one member fumbles, we are all there to help. In an effort to lead by example, I put my own growth out in the open sharing with my team things that go well or things I want to improve on. By focusing on team culture and ownerships, while making space for individual expression, I frequently ask "What do we want our brand to be?" and "How are building towards that together?" 

> **Social and emotional awareness**—I have a spidey sense that piques when I suspect scope creep, misaligned stakeholder expectations, or mounting design debt, in the interest of setting up the team for success. If I sense that someone was frustrated, sad, discouraged, rude, or otherwise I call it out in an appropriate setting, so that we can ensure we are observing the same thing and grow from there. While I have perfectionist tendencies myself, I know there is a right and wrong time to activate them. In leadership, I allow my bar for quality to be a goal post with clearly documented steps about how to get there.

> **Developer at heart**—With half of my friends and colleagues being developers. 

Have you ever worked remotely before?

>Since before it was cool. Seriously, since 2019.

What do you think are some of the challenges of working remotely, and how would you address them?
>Great question.

>1. Establishing trust — While I will always advocate for an in-person on-/off-site as a baseline, it's not an easy commitment for distributed teams. Personality mapping (creating team "baseball cards") and making those available can help inform how best to engage colleagues, fast-tracking what getting-to-know-someone takes over hundreds of micro interactions. Cultivate a culture of authenticity, humility, and zero judgement is just a precursor to trust. 

>2. Creative collaboration — FigJam and Slack can make a dent in this, but there is more. First, making sure that all work is done in the open; access by default, asking for feedback in public channels, group work sessions with no-lyric, deep focus music. Being in the same video room, quietly listening to music can feel odd at first, but it does wonders for connection. I also frequently encourage sharing content my team has engaged in outside of work and bring it in—sharing; what delighted them on a personal level, what asking "how might we apply this to our methods?" 

>3. "I home from work" vibes — Some say work from home, but the inverse can be bad for mental health. My trick here is: act like we are in an office. In a chat channel for example, my team has built a habit of "entering the room" with a "Good morning,  Spending a couple moments at the beginning and end of the day to shoot the shit. Closing the computer is ceremonial. 

How did you hear about this job?

> It came to me via LinkedIn. But, I also know a former employee, so the company has been on my radar for a while.
